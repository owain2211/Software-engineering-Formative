### What the code does
The code is an app which allows the user to either multiply or add two numbers, with the answer printed for the user within the app, it is written in python and makes use of the tkinter package, which provides all the functions to create a graphical user interface

### How the code was developed

* The first step was two decide what the app should do
* Next an intial design of what the app should look like was created
* After this a "dummy" version of the app could was created
* Once the "dummy" version looked right the functions which the buttons execute needed to be designed
* Next, the functionality was added to the buttons
* Finally. the app was tested

The progress of the app was tracked using a kanban board which can be seen below

The kanban board shows the project while the function which calculates the results after the button is clicked was being tested. The final item in the to do section is still incomplete at the moment.

### How to use the app

The app is designed to be simple to use, with only a single button and three data entry points, the final app along with the different features can be seen in the below
