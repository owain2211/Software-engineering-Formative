### What the code does
The code is an app which allows the user to either multiply or add two numbers, with the answer printed for the user within the app, it is written in python and makes use of the tkinter package, which provides all the functions to create a graphical user interface

### How the code was developed

* The first step was two decide what the app should do
* Next an intial design of what the app should look like was created
* After this a "dummy" version of the app could was created
* Once the "dummy" version looked right the functions which the buttons execute needed to be designed
* Next, the functionality was added to the buttons
* Finally. the app was tested

The progress of the app was tracked using a kanban board which can be seen below
